# DrDroid
VERY simple chatbot - originally for the neotrinkey and now in the FruitJam


Very minimal "chat" with NO parsing. The doctor chooses between Nulls, Questions, Affirmations and Comments to converse with the subject. Silly, but shows how little it takes to create the illusion of sentience.
